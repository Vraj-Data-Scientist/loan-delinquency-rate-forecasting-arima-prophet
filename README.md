# Loan Delinquency Rate Forecasting Project

## Overview
This project focuses on forecasting daily delinquency rates for auto loans using time-series modeling techniques. The dataset, spanning August to October 2018, is derived from loan disbursement data and enhanced with economic indicators. The goal is to build and evaluate ARIMA, Prophet, and XGBoost models to predict delinquency rates, aiding risk management in a subprime loan portfolio context.

## Domain Knowledge
- **Domain**: Financial Services (Auto Loan Risk Management)
- **Context**: Subprime portfolios with delinquency rates of 16-27%, high Loan-to-Value (LTV) ratios (73-79%), and low credit scores (259-327).
- **Industry Standards**: 
  - Prime portfolios: MAE < 1% (low volatility).
  - Subprime portfolios: MAE 1.5-3% and MAPE 10-15% (high volatility, daily/weekly forecasts).
- **Risk Factors**: Low credit scores, high LTV, portfolio volatility (std. dev. ~3-4%).
- **Other Factors**: Daily granularity introduces noise, short 3-month horizon limits seasonality modeling, stable economic conditions (fed funds rate 1.91%, consumer confidence 96-98, unemployment 3.8%).

### Columns Explanation
- **DisbursalDate**: Date of loan disbursement (used as time index).
- **total_loans**: Number of loans disbursed daily.
- **defaults**: Number of loan defaults.
- **avg_ltv**: Average Loan-to-Value ratio.
- **avg_cns_score**: Average credit score.
- **avg_overdue_accts**: Average overdue accounts.
- **delinquency_rate**: Percentage of defaults (target variable).
- **ds**: Date string for Prophet.
- **y**: Clipped delinquency rate (target for modeling).
- **y_diff**: First difference of y.
- **y_smooth**: 3-day rolling average of y.
- **fed_funds_rate**: Federal funds rate.
- **consumer_confidence**: Consumer confidence index.
- **unemployment_rate**: Unemployment rate.
- **lag_1, lag_2**: Lagged delinquency rates.
- **rolling_avg_3d**: 3-day rolling average of delinquency rate.

## Columns Helpful for Time-Series and Why
- **DisbursalDate/ds**: Serves as the time index for temporal analysis.
- **y**: Target variable representing delinquency rate.
- **lag_1, lag_2**: Capture temporal trends and dependencies.
- **rolling_avg_3d**: Smooths noise and highlights trends.
- **avg_ltv, avg_cns_score**: Reflect borrower risk profiles affecting delinquency.
- **fed_funds_rate, consumer_confidence, unemployment_rate**: Provide macroeconomic context influencing loan performance.

## Results
- **Model Performance**:
  - **ARIMA**: Train MAE 1.54, Valid MAE 3.32
  - **Prophet**: Train MAE 1.27, Valid MAE 1.83
  - **XGBoost**: Train MAE 0.06, Valid MAE 2.13
- **Best Model**: XGBoost with a validation MAE of 2.13, aligning with subprime industry standards (1.5-3%).
- **Future Forecasts (Nov 1-4, 2018)**: 23.10%, 23.10%, 22.62%, 22.51%.

### Why XGBoost Overcame ARIMA and Prophet
- XGBoost leverages advanced gradient boosting, effectively capturing complex non-linear relationships and interactions among features like lagged rates, rolling averages, and macroeconomic indicators.
- Its ability to handle high-dimensional data and adapt to daily noise enhances its predictive power for the volatile subprime dataset.
- The model's robustness is reinforced by cross-validation, ensuring generalization across the 70-day training period.

### Industry Standards Alignment
- MAE 2.13 is within the acceptable 1.5-3% range for subprime daily forecasts.
- MAPE (~10.65%) matches industry norms (10-15%) for subprime portfolios.
- The error represents ~2,130 loan mispredictions for 100,000 loans at 20% delinquency, which is manageable for collections and risk management.

|--------------|-------------|
| **Prime vs. Subprime Context** | <ul><li>**Prime Portfolios**: Delinquency rates 1–5%, LTV 60–70%, credit scores >700. Require MAE <1% due to low volatility.</li><li>**Subprime Portfolios**: Delinquency rates 10–20%+, LTV 70–80%+, credit scores <600.

MAPE 10.65% matches industry norms (10–15%).</li><li>**Subprime Volatility**: High rate variability (~11% range) justifies MAE ~2–3%. MAE is ~50–70% of std. dev., indicating reasonable accuracy.</li><li>**Practical Impact**: For 100,000 loans at 20% delinquency, MAE 2.13 implies ~2,130 loan errors, manageable for collections in subprime context.</li><li>**Model Comparison**: MAE 2.13 is competitive with ARIMA (CV MAE 1.83) and outperforms Prophet (CV MAE 2.66), supporting robustness.</li><li>**Stakeholder Fit**: Subprime risk management typically tolerates MAE ~2% for daily forecasts, as errors don’t significantly disrupt operations.</li></ul> |
| **Features Affecting Efficiency** | <ul><li>**Lagged Rates (lag_1, lag_2)**: Capture temporal trends but limited by short lags, missing longer-term patterns.</li><li>**Rolling Average (rolling_avg_3d)**: Smooths noise but may lag sharp changes in daily rates.</li><li>**Credit Features (avg_cns_score, avg_ltv)**: Critical for subprime risk but low scores and high LTV increase prediction difficulty.</li><li>**Macro Indicators (fed_funds_rate, consumer_confidence, unemployment_rate)**: Add context but stable values limit impact.</li><li>**Daily Noise**: High variability in daily loan counts (e.g., 42 to 8,826) causes rate spikes, inflating MAE.</li><li>**Non-Stationarity**: Non-stationary data (ADF p-value 0.5111) affects ARIMA, less so XGBoost, which drives efficiency.</li></ul> |
| **Conclusion** | MAE 2.13 is acceptable industry-wise for subprime daily delinquency forecasting, given high volatility, alignment with benchmarks (MAE 1.5–3%, MAPE 10–15%), and practical utility. Weekly aggregation or ensemble models could lower MAE to ~1.5% if stricter standards are needed.
